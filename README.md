# Applied Data Analyis - Project

## Reddit (nice title)

Has the high connectivity that came with the internet made us better? Is it fostering healthy discussion and debate between the different collectives or is the echo-chamber effect become predominant and we are actually become more divided?

Reddit is the "frontpage of the internet" (give some stats about reddit, user count, etc). It's developers have been open about the huge mount of information that flows around the site (more stats) and have always tried to keep up with the public's interest and to not fold to external biases (net neutrality?)

platform ideas:
Github pages?
upon finishing the project make a post in r/dataisbeautiful
with our results
