# Applied Data Analyis - Project

## Reddit <insert nice title here>

Has the high connectivity that came with the internet made us better? Is it fostering healthy discussion and debate between the different collectives or is the echo-chamber effect become predominant and we are actually become more divided?

Reddit is the "frontpage of the internet" (give some stats about reddit, user count, etc). It's developers have been open about the huge mount of information that flows around the site (more stats) and have always tried to keep up with the public's interest and to not fold to external biases (net neutrality?)

This dataset (all of reddit's comments from its inception and up to March 2017) has an interesting structure (subreddits) and it allows to filter specific topics and even has the comments tagged with usernames so we can watch for cross-interaction between subreddits, brigadding, troll detection, etc

topics that we could research:
- the battle for net neutrality
- the US 2016 election coverage (aka russian trolls)
- the evolution of whistleblowing and it's perception by the public (see Assange, Snowden, Wikileaks, etc) although cannot analyze khashoggi's case unless we retrieve the data ourselves, which is a possibility
- r/ProjectDiscovery and crowdsourced science

platform ideas:
Github pages?
upon finishing the project make a post in r/dataisbeautiful
with our results (see https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/9sny2t/growth_of_subreddits/)
